# StemAPI

StemAPI is a Tampermonkey extension allowing you to "unlock" the Stem websites (stem.tech & stemplayer.com) and let you listen to early and unreleased music by artists on the Stem platform. This extension will even let you view early website versions, and get every digital-based items (Artist subscriptions, etc.) free.

### How to use StemAPI
Install Tampermonkey to your browser and make a new extension. (If you don't know how to do this step, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyjJD65zws))

Copy and paste what is in [stemapi.js](https://github.com/Untitled-360/StemAPI/blob/main/stemapi.js) into your new extension.

Save that extension and enjoy your new permissions! This extension will work on **stem.tech** and **stemplayer.com**.

Note that this may not be the most effecient way to upload a tampermonkey extension. If there is a better way I am unaware of, feel free to make a pull request to this README.md file.

### Why can't I login?
Just to note, a developer / employee account will be required on these sites. To my knowledge, new accounts do not work on the “staging-stemplayer” version this runs on. I will keep my eye on this and update it once I find a fix.

# StemAPI

#### StemAPI is a Tampermonkey extension allowing you to "unlock" the Stem websites (stem.tech & stemplayer.com) and let you listen to early and unreleased music by artists on the Stem platform. This extension will even let you view early website versions, and get every digital-based items (Artist subscriptions, etc.) free.

#### How to use StemAPI
Install Tampermonkey to your browser and make a new extension. (If you don't know how to do this step, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=253D8tyjJD65zws))

###### Notes: Developer / employee account will be required. To my knowledge, new accounts do not work on the “staging-stemplayer” version this runs on. I will keep my eye on this and update it once I find a fix.
